A.2 The combination of feature 2 and feature 5 is better than combination of feature 6 and 3. Because the data points in combination of 2 and 5 are separate clearly and two classes have their own cluster, which shows directly. However, the combination of 6 and 3 has no such property.

C. When there are many 0s features, we should use log scaled. Because the 0 is terrible to determine the class and the log could diminish the impact of 0. When there is no 0s, we might use the square-root-scaled method.
